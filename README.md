Selling context is going to be a thing: one-time purchase of context. For example, now I need context for major LLM clients and their integration possibilities.

## Major LLM Clients

Here are all the agent-friendly entrypoints for major LLM clients.

- https://agentskills.io/llms.txt
- https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt
- https://platform.claude.com/llms.txt
- https://cursor.com/llms.txt
- https://developers.openai.com/llms.txt
  - https://developers.openai.com/codex/llms.txt
- https://docs.cline.bot/llms.txt
- https://docs.windsurf.com/llms.txt

## TODO: (these have no llms.txt and are worth making):

- https://ampcode.com/manual
- https://antigravity.google/docs/*
- https://kiro.dev/docs/*
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/* --> make llms.txt
- https://geminicli.com/llms.txt (is incorrect llms.txt format)

I need all of these overviews concatenated. Then I can more easily

Important Research Questions:

- Who's leading the standard adoption? Who's following?
  - For this I can see the blogs and changelogs for particular things.
- What is most worth integrating with? Low friction, high potential for adoption/distribution?
